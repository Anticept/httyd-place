# httyd-place

I made this because I wanted multiple people to be able to update the template image.

## HOW TO USE THE TEMPLATE AND SCRIPT ON /r/place
Our friends at r/osuplace have made an overlay script! Use this to make sure you're placing pixels in the right spot.

### Extension

USE THIS FOR CHROME/OPERA

USE THIS FOR FIREFOX

### Userscript

Install userscript.user.js from this repository to the addons listed above.

(If you're having trouble installing, check out this video to manually install the userscript [https://discord.com/channels/205770721085882370/958878173871886397/959513509102764033])

## Coordination Efforts

We're coordinating at [discord.gg/httyd] channel #httyd-place and on [reddit.com/r/httyd]

## To edit the template:

Edit the [toothless_full.png](toothless_full.png) file without changing the pixel dimensions. Then run the [dithering.py](dithering.py) script on the image. PR:

* YOUR EDITED toothless_full.png
* the output toothless_template.png

Merge it!
